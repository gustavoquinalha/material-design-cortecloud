# Wrapping up

By using some simple markup, ~100 lines of CSS, ~4 lines of JavaScript, and the Material Components for the web library, you have the start of a beautiful e-commerce app that conforms to the Material Design guidelines and looks great across all devices.

## Material Components

This was a quick example with just a few components but Material Components has so much more it can do on all platforms! Have your engineers go to [material.io/components](https://material.io/components) to see the amazing open-source code available for web, iOS, and Android.

You'll be amazed at the time and effort they save using the many free frameworks at tools available at [material.io](https://material.io).

Let's build beautiful apps faster!
