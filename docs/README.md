# Supporting documentation

This section includes supporting documentation aimed to both improve the onboarding experience for teams that are new to Material Components, as well as cover advanced issues for those interested in the reasoning behind our decisions and contributing to the project.

To jump right in and begin using the library, check out our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)

If you're interested in a general overview of MDC Web, check out [the MDC Repository README](../README.md).
