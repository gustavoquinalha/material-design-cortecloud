# Explore the starter code

While far from the end result we want, our skeleton site is looking pretty good already! Let’s take a look around.

## Open index.html and app.css

In Terminal, press `command + T` to open another tab.

Then copy and paste into the new tab `open -a "Sublime Text" app.css index.html`.

Sublime should open two files: `index.html` and `app.css`.

![Open files](img/04-open.png)
{: .codelab-img}

Now that you’ve opened the code, let’s implement our first feature!
