# Getting Started

## Quick Start

To try Material Components for the web with minimal setup, load the CSS and JS from unpkg:

```html
https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.css
https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.js
```

Then include MDC markup...

```html
<button class="foo-button mdc-button">Button</button>
```

...and instantiate JavaScript:

```js
mdc.ripple.MDCRipple.attachTo(document.querySelector('.foo-button'));
```

However, it is highly recommended to install Material Components for the web via npm and consume its ES2015 modules and Sass directly. This is outlined in the steps below.

## Using MDC Web with ES2015 and Sass

This section walks you through how to [install MDC Web Node modules](https://www.npmjs.com/org/material), and bundle the Sass and JavaScript from those Node modules in your [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration.

> Note: This guide assumes you have Node.js and npm installed locally.

### Step 1: Webpack with Sass

We’re going to use webpack-dev-server to demonstrate how webpack bundles our Sass and JavaScript. First create a package.json that looks like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server"
  }
}
```

You’ll need all of these Node dependencies:
- [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack): Bundles Sass and JavaScript
- [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server): Development server
- [sass-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader): Loads a Sass file and compiles it to CSS
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass): Provides binding for Node.js to Sass, peer dependency to sass-loader
- [css-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader): Resolves CSS @import and url() paths
- [extract-loader](https://github.com/peerigon/extract-loader): Extracts the CSS into a `.css` file
- [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader): Serves the `.css` file as a public URL

You can install all of them by running this command:

```
npm install --save-dev webpack@3 webpack-dev-server@2 css-loader sass-loader node-sass extract-loader file-loader
```

> Note: We recommend using webpack 3, because we're still investigating using webpack 4. We also recommend you use webpack-dev-server 2, because this works with webpack 3.

In order to demonstrate how webpack bundles our Sass, you’ll need an `index.html`. This HTML file needs to include CSS. The CSS is generated by sass-loader, which compiles Sass files into CSS. The CSS is extracted into a `.css` file by extract-loader. Create this simple “hello world” `index.html`:

```html
<html>
 <head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="bundle.css">
 </head>
 <body>Hello World</body>
</html>
```

And create a simple Sass file called `app.scss`:

```scss
body {
  color: blue;
}
```

Then configure webpack to convert `app.scss` into `bundle.css`. For that you need a new `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = [{
  entry: './app.scss',
  output: {
    // This is necessary for webpack to compile
    // But we never use style-bundle.js
    filename: 'style-bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.scss$/,
      use: [
        {
          loader: 'file-loader',
          options: {
            name: 'bundle.css',
          },
        },
        { loader: 'extract-loader' },
        { loader: 'css-loader' },
        { loader: 'sass-loader' },
      ]
    }]
  },
}];
```

To test your webpack configuration, run:

```
npm start
```

And open http://localhost:8080 in a browser. You should see a blue “Hello World”.

### Step 2: Include CSS for a component

Now that you have webpack configured to compile Sass into CSS, let's include the Sass files for the Material Design button. First install the Node dependency:

```
npm install @material/button
```

We need to tell our `app.scss` to import the Sass files for `@material/button`. We can also use Sass mixins to customize the button. Replace your “hello world” version of `app.scss` with this code:

```scss
@import "@material/button/mdc-button";

.foo-button {
  @include mdc-button-ink-color(teal);
  @include mdc-states(teal);
}
```

We also need to configure sass-loader to understand the `@material` imports used by MDC Web. Update your `webpack.config.js` by changing `{ loader: 'sass-loader' }` to:

```js
{
  loader: 'sass-loader',
  options: {
    includePaths: ['./node_modules']
  }
}
```

`@material/button` has [documentation](../packages/mdc-button/README.md) about the required HTML for a button. Update your `index.html` to include the MDC Button markup, and add the `foo-button` class to the element:

```html
<body>
  <button class="foo-button mdc-button">
    Button
  </button>
</body>
```

Now run `npm start` again and open http://localhost:8080. You should see a Material Design button!

<img src="button.png" alt="Button" width="90" height="36">

### Step 3: Webpack with ES2015

We need to configure webpack to bundle ES2015 JavaScript into standard JavaScript, through [babel](https://babeljs.io). You’ll need all of these dependencies:

- [babel-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core)
- [babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader): Compiles JavaScript files using babel
- [babel-preset-es2015](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015): Preset for compiling es2015

You can install all of them by running this command:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015
```

In order to demonstrate how webpack bundles our JavaScript, you’ll need to update `index.html` to include JavaScript. The JavaScript file is generated by babel-loader, which compiles ES2015 files into JavaScript. Add this script tag to `index.html`:

```html
<script src="bundle.js" async></script>
```

And create a simple ES2015 file called `app.js`:

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

Then configure webpack to convert `app.js` into `bundle.js` by adding the following code to the `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports.push({
  entry: './app.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      query: {
        presets: ['es2015']
      }
    }]
  },
});
```

Now run `npm start` again and open http://localhost:8080. You should see a “hello world” in the console.

### Step 4: Include JavaScript for a component

Now that you have webpack configured to compile ES2015 into JavaScript, let's include the ES2015 files from the Material Design ripple. First install the Node dependency:

```
npm install @material/ripple
```

We need to tell our `app.js` to import the ES2015 file for `@material/ripple`. We also need to initialize an `MDCRipple` with a DOM element. Replace your “hello world” version of `app.js` with this code:

```js
import {MDCRipple} from '@material/ripple';
const ripple = new MDCRipple(document.querySelector('.foo-button'));
```

Now run `npm start` again and open http://localhost:8080. You should see a Material Design ripple on the button!
