## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature, we'd love to hear about it! Please provide enough
information regarding the feature such that we'll be able to evaluate the appropriateness and
feasibility of your request. Try to be as specific as possible regarding your motivation, use-case,
and potential API or affects on other APIs (where applicable). The more detailed your proposal is,
the easier it will be for us to understand and evaluate it. [This Meta.SE answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259196) also contains great general guidelines for writing
feature requests.

If you'd like to work on a component, please ensure that you *submit an Engineering Outline before
submitting a pull request*. You can read more about this in our [contributing docs](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-components).

MDC Web is still under active development. You can see our current progress on [master](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master) as well as an overview of our [architecture and practices](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/code).

If you're interested in information for a specific component, check out our [component issues](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Av2-component) to see which milestone it's associated with and subscribe to updates to it. If an issue has the `in-tracker` label, you can also take a look at our [public Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1664011) for a rough estimate of when we'll get to it.

Our team prioritizes responding to as many engineering and user experience questions as possible. We do not support responses to questions outside of these areas at this time.
