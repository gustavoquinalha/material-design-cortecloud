# MDC Web team

MDC Web team members write and review code in this repository.
They work with other Material Design Engineers (Android and iOS)
and Designers to write design docs.

The APIs across Web, Android, and iOS are expected to match, and the final code
is expected to match [spec](https://material.io/guidelines).

MDC Web uses a two week sprint system to prioritize our feature requests and
tech debt. Tasks are prioritized on our [Pivotal tracker](#pivotal).

### GitHub

Contributors submit PRs through GitHub. MDC Web team members review the code
and documentation before merging it to master. Both code and documentation
are immediately available on GitHub once it is merged.

### Pivotal

[Pivotal Backlog + Icebox](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1664011)

All feature requests, and chores are filed in the Icebox. Once a week, the
Scrum Master moves these tasks into the Backlog. A Pivotal
story can have the following status:

* Unstarted: no branch for this feature
* Started: there is a branch for this feature
* Delivered: there is a PR for this feature
* Accepted: the PR is merged!

Each Pivotal story is pointed before it is included in a sprint.
Points represent both complexity and ambiguity in completing the story.
